WE WILL BE GIVING THESE OUT AT SUPERCON!!!
Won't be making many because we are broke college students, but we will have some. Also if anyone wou






Hey Mike,

I really don't know how to put this, so I'll just say what I'm doing and what I need help with.

At the beginning of the year I decided to make a TIL311 replica. I didn't really have a lot of time due to school and work. After the Supercon announcement, I began
work on this wanting to make it, along with a Shitty Add-On carrier board, for Supercon. So, it would be a SAO that would use a TIL311 (original or clone/replica) as a display.

While this would be awesome, I've run into a roadblock. I want to be able to give both the SAO carrier board and the TIL311 replica out at Supercon, but as a college student I don't
have the the money to just make a ton of these. Even just making about 200 TIL311s is proving to be quite expensive for me. And this is buying as much as I can in quantity. I already
have working prototypes of the TIL311s https://hackaday.io/project/166086-diytil311 but have not even looked at the SAO as I am well outside the amount of money I would like to spend.

I would like your advice on what you think my options are. Yes, some sort of sponsorship would be awesome if possible, however anything will help at this point.

Thanks,
Jacob
